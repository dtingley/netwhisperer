S'mr moderator brother lomax brothers and sisters friends and enemies just cant believe everyone in here is friend and dont want to leave anybody out the question tonight as understand it is the negro revolt and where do we go from here or what next in my little humble way of understanding it it points toward either the ballot or the bullet before we try and explain what is meant by the ballot or the bullet would like to clarify something concerning myself im still muslim my religion is still islam thats my personal belief just as adam clayton powell is christian minister who heads the abyssinian baptist church in new york but at the same time takes part in the political struggles to try and bring about rights to the black people in this country and dr martin luther king is christian minister down in atlanta georgia who heads another organization fighting for the civil rights of black people in this country and reverend galamison guess youve heard of him is another christian minister in new york who has been deeply involved in the school boycotts to eliminate segregated education well myself am minister not christian minister but muslim minister and believe in action on all fronts by whatever means necessary although im still muslim im not here tonight to discuss my religion im not here to try and change your religion im not here to argue or discuss anything that we differ about because its time for us to submerge our differences and realize that it is best for us to first see that we have the same problem common problem problem that will make you catch hell whether youre baptist or methodist or muslim or nationalist whether youre educated or illiterate whether you live on the boulevard or in the alley youre going to catch hell just like am were all in the same boat and we all are going to catch the same hell from the same man he just happens to be white man all of us have suffered here in this country political oppression at the hands of the white man economic exploitation at the hands of the white man and social degradation at the hands of the white man now in speaking like this it doesnt mean that were antiwhite but it does mean were antiexploitation were antidegradation were antioppression and if the white man doesnt want us to be antihim let him stop oppressing and exploiting and degrading us whether we are christians or muslims or nationalists or agnostics or atheists we must first learn to forget our differences if we have differences let us differ in the closet when we come out in front let us not have anything to argue about until we get finished arguing with the man if the late president kennedy could get together with khrushchev and exchange some wheat we certainly have more in common with each other than kennedy and khrushchev had with each other if we dont do something real soon think youll have to agree that were going to be forced either to use the ballot or the bullet its one or the other in  it isnt that time is running out  time has run out  threatens to be the most explosive year america has ever witnessed the most explosive year why its also political year its the year when all of the white politicians will be back in the socalled negro community jiving you and me for some votes the year when all of the white political crooks will be right back in your and my community with their false promises building up our hopes for letdown with their trickery and their treachery with their false promises which they dont intend to keep as they nourish these dissatisfactions it can only lead to one thing an explosion and now we have the type of black man on the scene in america today  im sorry brother lomax  who just doesnt intend to turn the other cheek any longer dont let anybody tell you anything about the odds are against you if they draft you they send you to korea and make you face  million chinese if you can be brave over there you can be brave right here these odds arent as great as those odds and if you fight here you will at least know what youre fighting for im not politician not even student of politics in fact im not student of much of anything im not democrat im not republican and dont even consider myself an american if you and were americans thered be no problem those honkies that just got off the boat theyre already americans polacks are already americans the italian refugees are already americans everything that came out of europe every blueeyed thing is already an american and as long as you and have been over here we arent americans yet well am one who doesnt believe in deluding myself im not going to sit at your table and watch you eat with nothing on my plate and call myself diner sitting at the table doesnt make you diner unless you eat some of whats on that plate being here in america doesnt make you an american being born here in america doesnt make you an american why if birth made you american you wouldnt need any legislation you wouldnt need any amendments to the constitution you wouldnt be faced with civilrights filibustering in washington dc right now they dont have to pass civilrights legislation to make polack an american no im not an american im one of the  million black people who are the victims of americanism one of the  million black people who are the victims of democracy nothing but disguised hypocrisy so im not standing here speaking to you as an american or patriot or flagsaluter or flagwaver  no not i im speaking as victim of this american system and see america through the eyes of the victim dont see any american dream see an american nightmare these  million victims are waking up their eyes are coming open theyre beginning to see what they used to only look at theyre becoming politically mature they are realizing that there are new political trends from coast to coast as they see these new political trends its possible for them to see that every time theres an election the races are so close that they have to have recount they had to recount in massachusetts to see who was going to be governor it was so close it was the same way in rhode island in minnesota and in many other parts of the country and the same with kennedy and nixon when they ran for president it was so close they had to count all over again well what does this mean it means that when white people are evenly divided and black people have bloc of votes of their own it is left up to them to determine whos going to sit in the white house and whos going to be in the dog house lt was the black mans vote that put the present administration in washington dc your vote your dumb vote your ignorant vote your wasted vote put in an administration in washington dc that has seen fit to pass every kind of legislation imaginable saving you until last then filibustering on top of that and your and my leaders have the audacity to run around clapping their hands and talk about how much progress were making and what good president we have if he wasnt good in texas he sure cant be good in washington dc because texas is lynch state it is in the same breath as mississippi no different only they lynch you in texas with texas accent and lynch you in mississippi with mississippi accent and these negro leaders have the audacity to go and have some coffee in the white house with texan southern cracker  thats all he is  and then come out and tell you and me that hes going to be better for us because since hes from the south he knows how to deal with the southerners what kind of logic is that let eastland be president hes from the south too he should be better able to deal with them than johnson in this present administration they have in the house of representatives  democrats to only  republicans they control twothirds of the house vote why cant they pass something that will help you and me in the senate there are  senators who are of the democratic party only  of them are republicans why the democrats have got the government sewed up and youre the one who sewed it up for them and what have they given you for it four years in office and just now getting around to some civilrights legislation just now after everything else is gone out of the way theyre going to sit down now and play with you all summer long  the same old giant con game that they call filibuster all those are in cahoots together dont you ever think theyre not in cahoots together for the man that is heading the civilrights filibuster is man from georgia named richard russell when johnson became president the first man he asked for when he got back to washington dc was dicky  thats how tight they are thats his boy thats his pal thats his buddy but theyre playing that old con game one of them makes believe hes for you and hes got it fixed where the other one is so tight against you he never has to keep his promise so its time in  to wake up and when you see them coming up with that kind of conspiracy let them know your eyes are open and let them know you  something else thats wide open too its got to be the ballot or the bullet the ballot or the bullet if youre afraid to use an expression like that you should get on out of the country you should get back in the cotton patch you should get back in the alley they get all the negro vote and after they get it the negro gets nothing in return all they did when they got to washington was give few big negroes big jobs those big negroes didnt need big jobs they already had jobs thats camouflage thats trickery thats treachery windowdressing im not trying to knock out the democrats for the republicans well get to them in minute but it is true you put the democrats first and the democrats put you last look at it the way it is what alibis do they use since they control congress and the senate what alibi do they use when you and ask well when are you going to keep your promise they blame the dixiecrats what is dixiecrat democrat dixiecrat is nothing but democrat in disguise the titular head of the democrats is also the head of the dixiecrats because the dixiecrats are part of the democratic party the democrats have never kicked the dixiecrats out of the party the dixiecrats bolted themselves once but the democrats didnt put them out imagine these lowdown southern segregationists put the northern democrats down but the northern democrats have never put the dixiecrats down no look at that thing the way it is they have got con game going on political con game and you and are in the middle its time for you and me to wake up and start looking at it like it is and trying to understand it like it is and then we can deal with it like it is the dixiecrats in washington dc control the key committees that run the government the only reason the dixiecrats control these committees is because they have seniority the only reason they have seniority is because they come from states where negroes cant vote this is not even government thats based on democracy lt is not government that is made up of representatives of the people half of the people in the south cant even vote eastland is not even supposed to be in washington half of the senators and congressmen who occupy these key positions in washington dc are there illegally are there unconstitutionally was in washington dc week ago thursday when they were debating whether or not they should let the bill come onto the floor and in the back of the room where the senate meets theres huge map of the united states and on that map it shows the location of negroes throughout the country and it shows that the southern section of the country the states that are most heavily concentrated with negroes are the ones that have senators and congressmen standing up filibustering and doing all other kinds of trickery to keep the negro from being able to vote this is pitiful but its not pitiful for us any longer its actually pitiful for the white man because soon now as the negro awakens little more and sees the vise that hes in sees the bag that hes in sees the real game that hes in then the negros going to develop new tactic these senators and congressmen actually violate the constitutional amendments that guarantee the people of that particular state or county the right to vote and the constitution itself has within it the machinery to expel any representative from state where the voting rights of the people are violated you dont even need new legislation any person in congress right now who is there from state or district where the voting rights of the people are violated that particular person should be expelled from congress and when you expel him youve removed one of the obstacles in the path of any real meaningful legislation in this country in fact when you expel them you dont need new legislation because they will be replaced by black representatives from counties and districts where the black man is in the majority not in the minority if the black man in these southern states had his full voting rights the key dixiecrats in washington d c which means the key democrats in washington dc would lose their seats the democratic party itself would lose its power it would cease to be powerful as party when you see the amount of power that would be lost by the democratic party if it were to lose the dixiecrat wing or branch or element you can see where its against the interests of the democrats to give voting rights to negroes in states where the democrats have been in complete power and authority ever since the civil war you just cant belong to that party without analyzing it say again im not antidemocrat im not antirepublican im not antianything im just questioning their sincerity and some of the strategy that theyve been using on our people by promising them promises that they dont intend to keep when you keep the democrats in power youre keeping the dixiecrats in power doubt that my good brother lomax will deny that vote for democrat is vote for dixiecrat thats why in  its time now for you and me to become more politically mature and realize what the ballot is for what were supposed to get when we cast ballot and that if we dont cast ballot its going to end up in situation where were going to have to cast bullet its either ballot or bullet in the north they do it different way they have system thats known as gerrymandering whatever that means it means when negroes become too heavily concentrated in certain area and begin to gain too much political power the white man comes along and changes the district lines you may say why do you keep saying white man because its the white man who does it havent ever seen any negro changing any lines they dont let him get near the line its the white man who does this and usually its the white man who grins at you the most and pats you on the back and is supposed to be your friend he may be friendly but hes not your friend so what im trying to impress upon you in essence is this you and in america are faced not with segregationist conspiracy were faced with government conspiracy everyone whos filibustering is senator  thats the government everyone whos finagling in washington dc is congressman  thats the government you dont have anybody putting blocks in your path but people who are part of the government the same government that you go abroad to fight for and die for is the government that is in conspiracy to deprive you of your voting rights deprive you of your economic opportunities deprive you of decent housing deprive you of decent education you dont need to go to the employer alone it is the government itself the government of america that is responsible for the oppression and exploitation and degradation of black people in this country and you should drop it in their lap this government has failed the negro this socalled democracy has failed the negro and all these white liberals have definitely failed the negro so where do we go from here first we need some friends we need some new allies the entire civilrights struggle needs new interpretation broader interpretation we need to look at this civilrights thing from another angle  from the inside as well as from the outside to those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism the only way you can get involved in the civilrights struggle is give it new interpretation that old interpretation excluded us it kept us out so were giving new interpretation to the civilrights struggle an interpretation that will enable us to come into it take part in it and these handkerchiefheads who have been dillydallying and pussy footing and compromising  we dont intend to let them pussyfoot and dillydally and compromise any longer how can you thank man for giving you whats already yours how then can you thank him for giving you only part of whats already yours you havent even made progress if whats being given to you you should have had already thats not progress and love my brother lomax the way he pointed out were right back where we were in  were not even as far up as we were in  were behind where we were in  theres more segregation now than there was in  theres more racial animosity more racial hatred more racial violence today in  than there was in  where is the progress and now youre facing situation where the young negros coming up they dont want to hear that turn theothercheek stuff no in jacksonville those were teenagers they were throwing molotov cocktails negroes have never done that before but it shows you theres new deal coming in theres new thinking coming in theres new strategy coming in itll be molotov cocktails this month hand grenades next month and something else next month itll be ballots or itll be bullets itll be liberty or it will be death the only difference about this kind of death  itll be reciprocal you know what is meant by reciprocal thats one of brother lomaxs words stole it from him dont usually deal with those big words because dont usually deal with big people deal with small people find you can get whole lot of small people and whip hell out of whole lot of big people they havent got anything to lose and theyve got every thing to gain and theyll let you know in minute it takes two to tango when go you go the black nationalists those whose philosophy is black nationalism in bringing about this new interpretation of the entire meaning of civil rights look upon it as meaning as brother lomax has pointed out equality of opportunity well were justified in seeking civil rights if it means equality of opportunity because all were doing there is trying to collect for our investment our mothers and fathers invested sweat and blood three hundred and ten years we worked in this country without dime in return  mean without dime in return you let the white man walk around here talking about how rich this country is but you never stop to think how it got rich so quick it got rich because you made it rich you take the people who are in this audience right now theyre poor were all poor as individuals our weekly salary individually amounts to hardly anything but if you take the salary of everyone in here collectively itll fill up whole lot of baskets its lot of wealth if you can collect the wages of just these people right here for year youll be rich  richer than rich when you look at it like that think how rich uncle sam had to become not with this handful but millions of black people your and my mother and father who didnt work an eighthour shift but worked from cant see in the morning until cant see at night and worked for nothing making the white man rich making uncle sam rich this is our investment this is our contribution our blood not only did we give of our free labor we gave of our blood every time he had call to arms we were the first ones in uniform we died on every battlefield the white man had we have made greater sacrifice than anybody whos standing up in america today we have made greater contribution and have collected less civil rights for those of us whose philosophy is black nationalism means give it to us now dont wait for next year give it to us yesterday and thats not fast enough might stop right here to point out one thing whenever youre going after something that belongs to you anyone whos depriving you of the right to have it is criminal understand that whenever you are going after something that is yours you are within your legal rights to lay claim to it and anyone who puts forth any effort to deprive you of that which is yours is breaking the law is criminal and this was pointed out by the supreme court decision it outlawed segregation which means segregation is against the law which means segregationist is breaking the law segregationist is criminal you cant label him as anything other than that and when you demonstrate against segregation the law is on your side the supreme court is on your side now who is it that opposes you in carrying out the law the police department itself with police dogs and clubs whenever you demonstrate against segregation whether it is segregated education segregated housing or anything else the law is on your side and anyone who stands in the way is not the law any longer they are breaking the law they are not representatives of the law any time you demonstrate against segregation and man has the audacity to put police dog on you kill that dog kill him im telling you kill that dog say it if they put me in jail tomorrow kill that dog then youll put stop to it now if these white people in here dont want to see that kind of action get down and tell the mayor to tell the police department to pull the dogs in thats all you have to do if you dont do it someone else will if you dont take this kind of stand your little children will grow up and look at you and think shame if you dont take an uncompromising stand dont mean go out and get violent but at the same time you should never be nonviolent unless you run into some nonviolence im nonviolent with those who are nonviolent with me but when you drop that violence on me then youve made me go insane and im not responsible for what do and thats the way every negro should get any time you know youre within the law within your legal rights within your moral rights in accord with justice then die for what you believe in but dont die alone let your dying be reciprocal this is what is meant by equality whats good for the goose is good for the gander when we begin to get in this area we need new friends we need new allies we need to expand the civilrights struggle to higher level  to the level of human rights whenever you are in civilrights struggle whether you know it or not you are confining yourself to the jurisdiction of uncle sam no one from the outside world can speak out in your behalf as long as your struggle is civilrights struggle civil rights comes within the domestic affairs of this country all of our african brothers and our asian brothers and our latinamerican brothers cannot open their mouths and interfere in the domestic affairs of the united states and as long as its civil rights this comes under the jurisdiction of uncle sam but the united nations has whats known as the charter of human rights it has committee that deals in human rights you may wonder why all of the atrocities that have been committed in africa and in hungary and in asia and in latin america are brought before the un and the negro problem is never brought before the un this is part of the conspiracy this old tricky blue eyed liberal who is supposed to be your and my friend supposed to be in our corner supposed to be subsidizing our struggle and supposed to be acting in the capacity of an adviser never tells you anything about human rights they keep you wrapped up in civil rights and you spend so much time barking up the civilrights tree you dont even know theres humanrights tree on the same floor when you expand the civilrights struggle to the level of human rights you can then take the case of the black man in this country before the nations in the un you can take it before the general assembly you can take uncle sam before world court but the only level you can do it on is the level of human rights civil rights keeps you under his restrictions under his jurisdiction civil rights keeps you in his pocket civil rights means youre asking uncle sam to treat you right human rights are something you were born with human rights are your godgiven rights human rights are the rights that are recognized by all nations of this earth and any time any one violates your human rights you can take them to the world court uncle sams hands are dripping with blood dripping with the blood of the black man in this country hes the earths numberone hypocrite he has the audacity  yes he has  imagine him posing as the leader of the free world the free world and you over here singing we shall overcome expand the civilrights struggle to the level of human rights take it into the united nations where our african brothers can throw their weight on our side where our asian brothers can throw their weight on our side where our latinamerican brothers can throw their weight on our side and where  million chinamen are sitting there waiting to throw their weight on our side let the world know how bloody his hands are let the world know the hypocrisy thats practiced over here let it be the ballot or the bullet let him know that it must be the ballot or the bullet when you take your case to washington dc youre taking it to the criminal whos responsible its like running from the wolf to the fox theyre all in cahoots together they all work political chicanery and make you look like chump before the eyes of the world here you are walking around in america getting ready to be drafted and sent abroad like tin soldier and when you get over there people ask you what are you fighting for and you have to stick your tongue in your cheek no take uncle sam to court take him before the world by ballot only mean freedom dont you know  disagree with lomax on this issue  that the ballot is more important than the dollar can prove it yes look in the un there are poor nations in the un yet those poor nations can get together with their voting power and keep the rich nations from making move they have one nation  one vote everyone has an equal vote and when those brothers from asia and africa and the darker parts of this earth get together their voting power is sufficient to hold sam in check or russia in check or some other section of the earth in check so the ballot is most important right now in this country if you and i  million africanamericans  thats what we are  africans who are in america youre nothing but africans nothing but africans in fact youd get farther calling yourself african instead of negro africans dont catch hell youre the only one catching hell they dont have to pass civilrights bills for africans an african can go anywhere he wants right now all youve got to do is tie your head up thats right go anywhere you want just stop being negro change your name to hoogagagooba thatll show you how silly the white man is youre dealing with silly man friend of mine whos very dark put turban on his head and went into restaurant in atlanta before they called themselves desegregated he went into white restaurant he sat down they served him and he said what would happen if negro came in here and there hes sitting black as night but because he had his head wrapped up the waitress looked back at him and says why there wouldnt no nigger dare come in here so youre dealing with man whose bias and prejudice are making him lose his mind his intelligence every day hes frightened he looks around and sees whats taking place on this earth and he sees that the pendulum of time is swinging in your direction the dark people are waking up theyre losing their fear of the white man no place where hes fighting right now is he winning everywhere hes fighting hes fighting someone your and my complexion and theyre beating him he cant win any more hes won his last battle he failed to win the korean war he couldnt win it he had to sign truce thats loss any time uncle sam with all his machinery for warfare is held to draw by some rice eaters hes lost the battle he had to sign truce americas not supposed to sign truce shes supposed to be bad but shes not bad any more shes bad as long as she can use her hydrogen bomb but she cant use hers for fear russia might use hers russia cant use hers for fear that sam might use his so both of them are weaponless they cant use the weapon because eachs weapon nullifies the others so the only place where action can take place is on the ground and the white man cant win another war fighting on the ground those days are over the black man knows it the brown man knows it the red man knows it and the yellow man knows it so they engage him in guerrilla warfare thats not his style youve got to have heart to be guerrilla warrior and he hasnt got any heart im telling you now just want to give you little briefing on guerrilla warfare because before you know it before you know it it takes heart to be guerrilla warrior because youre on your own in conventional warfare you have tanks and whole lot of other people with you to back you up  planes over your head and all that kind of stuff but guerrilla is on his own all you have is rifle some sneakers and bowl of rice and thats all you need  and lot of heart the japanese on some of those islands in the pacific when the american soldiers landed one japanese sometimes could hold the whole army off hed just wait until the sun went down and when the sun went down they were all equal he would take his little blade and slip from bush to bush and from american to american the white soldiers couldnt cope with that whenever you see white soldier that fought in the pacific he has the shakes he has nervous condition because they scared him to death the same thing happened to the french up in french indochina people who just few years previously were rice farmers got together and ran the heavilymechanized french army out of indochina you dont need it  modern warfare today wont work this is the day of the guerrilla they did the same thing in algeria algerians who were nothing but bedouins took rine and sneaked off to the hills and de gaulle and all of his highfalutin war machinery couldnt defeat those guerrillas nowhere on this earth does the white man win in guerrilla warfare its not his speed just as guerrilla warfare is prevailing in asia and in parts of africa and in parts of latin america youve got to be mighty naive or youve got to play the black man cheap if you dont think some day hes going to wake up and find that its got to be the ballot or the bullet would like to say in closing few things concerning the muslim mosque inc which we established recently in new york city its true were muslims and our religion is islam but we dont mix our religion with our politics and our economics and our social and civil activities  not any more we keep our religion in our mosque after our religious services are over then as muslims we become involved in political action economic action and social and civic action we become involved with anybody any where any time and in any manner thats designed to eliminate the evils the political economic and social evils that are afflicting the people of our community the political philosophy of black nationalism means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community no more the black man in the black community has to be reeducated into the science of politics so he will know what politics is supposed to bring him in return dont be throwing out any ballots ballot is like bullet you dont throw your ballots until you see target and if that target is not within your reach keep your ballot in your pocket the political philosophy of black nationalism is being taught in the christian church its being taught in the naacp its being taught in core meetings its being taught in sncc student nonviolent coordinating committee meetings its being taught in muslim meetings its being taught where nothing but atheists and agnostics come together its being taught everywhere black people are fed up with the dillydallying pussyfooting compromising approach that weve been using toward getting our freedom we want freedom now but were not going to get it saying we shall overcome weve got to fight until we overcome the economic philosophy of black nationalism is pure and simple it only means that we should control the economy of our community why should white people be running all the stores in our community why should white people be running the banks of our community why should the economy of our community be in the hands of the white man why if black man cant move his store into white community you tell me why white man should move his store into black community the philosophy of black nationalism involves reeducation program in the black community in regards to economics our people have to be made to see that any time you take your dollar out of your community and spend it in community where you dont live the community where you live will get poorer and poorer and the community where you spend your money will get richer and richer then you wonder why where you live is always ghetto or slum area and where you and are concerned not only do we lose it when we spend it out of the community but the white man has got all our stores in the community tied up so that though we spend it in the community at sundown the man who runs the store takes it over across town somewhere hes got us in vise so the economic philosophy of black nationalism means in every church in every civic organization in every fraternal order its time now for our people to be come conscious of the importance of controlling the economy of our community if we own the stores if we operate the businesses if we try and establish some industry in our own community then were developing to the position where we are creating employment for our own kind once you gain control of the economy of your own community then you dont have to picket and boycott and beg some cracker downtown for job in his business the social philosophy of black nationalism only means that we have to get together and remove the evils the vices alcoholism drug addiction and other evils that are destroying the moral fiber of our community we our selves have to lift the level of our community the standard of our community to higher level make our own society beautiful so that we will be satisfied in our own social circles and wont be running around here trying to knock our way into social circle where were not wanted so say in spreading gospel such as black nationalism it is not designed to make the black man reevaluate the white man  you know him already  but to make the black man reevaluate himself dont change the white mans mind  you cant change his mind and that whole thing about appealing to the moral conscience of america  americas conscience is bankrupt she lost all conscience long time ago uncle sam has no conscience they dont know what morals are they dont try and eliminate an evil because its evil or because its illegal or because its immoral they eliminate it only when it threatens their existence so youre wasting your time appealing to the moral conscience of bankrupt man like uncle sam if he had conscience hed straighten this thing out with no more pressure being put upon him so it is not necessary to change the white mans mind we have to change our own mind you cant change his mind about us weve got to change our own minds about each other we have to see each other with new eyes we have to see each other as brothers and sisters we have to come together with warmth so we can develop unity and harmony thats necessary to get this problem solved ourselves how can we do this how can we avoid jealousy how can we avoid the suspicion and the divisions that exist in the community ill tell you how have watched how billy graham comes into city spreading what he calls the gospel of christ which is only white nationalism thats what he is billy graham is white nationalist im black nationalist but since its the natural tendency for leaders to be jealous and look upon powerful figure like graham with suspicion and envy how is it possible for him to come into city and get all the cooperation of the church leaders dont think because theyre church leaders that they dont have weaknesses that make them envious and jealous  no everybodys got it its not an accident that when they want to choose cardinal as pope over there in rome they get in closet so you cant hear them cussing and fighting and carrying on billy graham comes in preaching the gospel of christ he evangelizes the gospel he stirs everybody up but he never tries to start church if he came in trying to start church all the churches would be against him so he just comes in talking about christ and tells everybody who gets christ to go to any church where christ is and in this way the church cooperates with him so were going to take page from his book our gospel is black nationalism were not trying to threaten the existence of any organization but were spreading the gospel of black nationalism anywhere theres church that is also preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism join that church if the naacp is preaching and practicing the gospel of black nationalism join the naacp if core is spreading and practicing the gospel of black nationalism join core join any organization that has gospel thats for the uplift of the black man and when you get into it and see them pussyfooting or compromising pull out of it because thats not black nationalism well find another one and in this manner the organizations will increase in number and in quantity and in quality and by august it is then our intention to have black nationalist convention which will consist of delegates from all over the country who are interested in the political economic and social philosophy of black nationalism after these delegates convene we will hold seminar we will hold discussions we will listen to everyone we want to hear new ideas and new solutions and new answers and at that time if we see fit then to form black nationalist party well form black nationalist party if its necessary to form black nationalist army well form black nationalist army itll be the ballot or the bullet itll be liberty or itll be death its time for you and me to stop sitting in this country letting some cracker senators northern crackers and southern crackers sit there in washington dc and come to conclusion in their mind that you and are supposed to have civil rights theres no white man going to tell me anything about my rights brothers and sisters always remember if it doesnt take senators and congressmen and presidential proclamations to give freedom to the white man it is not necessary for legislation or proclamation or supreme court decisions to give freedom to the black man you let that white man know if this is country of freedom let it be country of freedom and if its not country of freedom change it we will work with anybody anywhere at any time who is genuinely interested in tackling the problem headon nonviolently as long as the enemy is nonviolent but violent when the enemy gets violent well work with you on the voterregistration drive well work with you on rent strikes well work with you on school boycotts dont believe in any kind of integration im not even worried about it because know youre not going to get it anyway youre not going to get it because youre afraid to die youve got to be ready to die if you try and force yourself on the white man because hell get just as violent as those crackers in mississippi right here in cleveland but we will still work with you on the school boycotts be cause were against segregated school system segregated school system produces children who when they graduate graduate with crippled minds but this does not mean that school is segregated because its all black segregated school means school that is controlled by people who have no real interest in it whatsoever let me explain what mean segregated district or community is community in which people live but outsiders control the politics and the economy of that community they never refer to the white section as segregated community its the allnegro section thats segregated community why the white man controls his own school his own bank his own economy his own politics his own everything his own community but he also controls yours when youre under someone elses control youre segregated theyll always give you the lowest or the worst that there is to offer but it doesnt mean youre segregated just because you have your own youve got to control your own just like the white man has control of his you need to control yours you know the best way to get rid of segregation the white man is more afraid of separation than he is of integration segregation means that he puts you away from him but not far enough for you to be out of his jurisdiction separation means youre gone and the white man will integrate faster than hell let you separate so we will work with you against the segregated school system because its criminal because it is absolutely destructive in every way imaginable to the minds of the children who have to be exposed to that type of crippling education last but not least must say this concerning the great controversy over rifles and shotguns the only thing that ive ever said is that in areas where the government has proven itself either unwilling or unable to defend the lives and the property of negroes its time for negroes to defend themselves article number two of the constitutional amendments provides you and me the right to own rifle or shotgun it is constitutionally legal to own shotgun or rifle this doesnt mean youre going to get rifle and form battalions and go out looking for white folks although youd be within your rights  mean youd be justified but that would be illegal and we dont do anything illegal if the white man doesnt want the black man buying rifles and shotguns then let the government do its job thats all and dont let the white man come to you and ask you what you think about what malcolm says  why you old uncle tom he would never ask you if he thought you were going to say amen no he is making tom out of you so this doesnt mean forming rifle clubs and going out looking for people but it is time in  if you are man to let that man know if hes not going to do his job in running the government and providing you and me with the protection that our taxes are supposed to be for since he spends all those billions for his defense budget he certainly cant begrudge you and me spending  or  for singleshot or doubleaction hope you understand dont go out shooting people but any time  brothers and sisters and especially the men in this audience some of you wearing congressional medals of honor with shoulders this wide chests this big muscles that big  any time you and sit around and read where they bomb church and murder in cold blood not some grownups but four little girls while they were praying to the same god the white man taught them to pray to and you and see the government go down and cant find who did it why this man  he can find eichmann hiding down in argentina somewhere let two or three american soldiers who are minding somebody elses business way over in south vietnam get killed and hell send battleships sticking his nose in their business he wanted to send troops down to cuba and make them have what he calls free elections  this old cracker who doesnt have free elections in his own country no if you never see me another time in your life if die in the morning ill die saying one thing the ballot or the bullet the ballot or the bullet if negro in  has to sit around and wait for some cracker senator to filibuster when it comes to the rights of black people why you and should hang our heads in shame you talk about march on washington in  you havent seen anything theres some more going down in  and this time theyre not going like they went last year theyre not going singing we shall overcome theyre not going with white friends theyre not going with placards already painted for them theyre not going with roundtrip tickets theyre going with one way tickets and if they dont want that nonnonviolent army going down there tell them to bring the filibuster to halt the black nationalists arent going to wait lyndon b johnson is the head of the democratic party if hes for civil rights let him go into the senate next week and declare himself let him go in there right now and declare himself let him go in there and denounce the southern branch of his party let him go in there right now and take moral stand  right now not later tell him dont wait until election time if he waits too long brothers and sisters he will be responsible for letting condition develop in this country which will create climate that will bring seeds up out of the ground with vegetation on the end of them looking like something these people never dreamed of in  its the ballot or the bullet thank you '
